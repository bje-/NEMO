NEMO is a chronological production-cost and capacity expansion model for testing and optimising different portfolios of renewable and fossil electricity generation technologies. It has been developed and improved over the past decade and has a growing number of users.

It requires no proprietary software to run, making it particularly accessible to the governments of developing countries, academic researchers and students. The model is available for others to inspect and, importantly, to validate the results.

## Installation

```bash
pip install nemopt
```
## Features

For a set of given (or default) generation or demand traces, users can:

1. Specify & simulate a custom resource mix, or;
2. "Evolve" a resource mix using pre-configured scenarios, or configure their own scenario
    
### Evolution strategy

The benefit of an evolutionary approach is that NEMO in searching for the least-cost solution, NEMO can also explore "near-optimal" resource mixes.

NEMO no longer uses genetic algorithms, but has adopted the better performing [CMA-ES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES) method.

### Resource models

NEMO has models for the following resources: wind (including offshore), photovoltaics, concentrating solar power (CSP), hydropower, pumped storage hydro, biomass, black coal, open cycle gas turbines (OCGTs), combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs), diesel generators, coal with carbon capture and storage (CCS), CCGT with CCS, geothermal, demand response, batteries, electrolysers, hydrogen fuelled gas turbines, and more.

## Documentation

Documentation is progressively being added to a [User's Guide](https://nbviewer.org/urls/nemo.ozlabs.org/guide.ipynb?flush_cache=1) in the form of a Jupyter notebook.

[API documentation](http://nemo.ozlabs.org/pdoc/index.html) exists for the `nemo` module. This is useful when building new tools that use the simulation framework.

The model is described in an Energy Policy paper titled [Least cost 100%
renewable electricity scenarios in the Australian National Electricity
Market](http://ceem.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/documents/LeastCostElectricityScenariosInPress2013.pdf) by Elliston, MacGill and Diesendorf (2013). 

## System requirements

NEMO should run on any operating system where Python 3 is available (eg, Windows, Mac OS X, Linux). It utilises some add-on packages:

- [DEAP](https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/),
- [Gooey](https://pypi.org/project/Gooey/),
- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/),
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and
- [Pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io).

### Scaling up

For simple simulations or scripted sensitivity analyses, a laptop or desktop PC will be adequate. However, for optimising larger systems, a cluster of compute nodes is desirable. The model is scalable and you can devote as many locally available CPU cores to the model as you wish. 

> **Note**
> 
> Due to a lack of active development, support for [SCOOP](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scoop) has been removed. It will be soon replaced with something like [Ray](https://ray.io/).

undergraduate and postgraduate student users at UNSW who have provided
valuable feedback on how to improve (and document!) the model.
